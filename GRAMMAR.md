Language Grammar
===
the grammar of river. currently a mess but will get better with time.

# Notation:

rules are in snake_case, and are defined with the following pattern:

```
rule:
      production
      | ( production | production )
```

the `|` character means `or`, and rules can be grouped via parenthesis for clarity.

terminals are wrapped in quotes `"import"`.

production rules can be followed up with any of the following operators:
```
*: Needs zero or more of
+: Needs one or more of
?: Either one or zero of
```

```

iden:
       [a-zA-Z_]+

number:
      int | float
